pyghdl is a language server for VHDL based on ghdl.

It implements the Language Server Protocol.
The server is implemented in Python (3.x) but relies on libghdl for parsing.

It also provides a python interface to libghdl, which could be used to
develop tools around the parser and analyzer.

To install:
1) First install ghdl (add --enable-python during configuration).
   This is needed so that the libraries are available
2) In ghdl, install pyGHDL.  There is a setup.py script, so you can do:
   $ pip install .
   To install for development: pip install -e .
   Add --user to install in your home directory.

The executable is named 'ghdl-ls'.  It uses stdin/stdout to communicate with
its client.
